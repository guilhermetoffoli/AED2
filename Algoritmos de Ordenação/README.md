-bubbleSort - the simplest sorting algorithm that runs through the list repeatedly, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are out of order.

-insertionSort - iterates through an input array and removes one element per iteration, finds the place the element belongs in the array, and then places it there.

-selectionSort - takes the smallest element in an unsorted array and bringing it to the front, it repeats until the array is sorted.

-heapSort - organizes elements in an array to be sorted into a binary heap by repeatedly moving the largest element front he heap and inserting it into the array being sorted.

-mergeSort - one of the most efficient sorting algorithms. It works on the principle of Divide and Conquer based on the idea of breaking down a list into several sub-lists until 
each sublist consists of a single element and merging those sublists in a manner that results into a sorted list.

-quickSort - one of the most efficient sorting algorithms. It works on the principle of Divide and Conquer based on the idea of breaking down a list into several sub-lists until each sublist 
consists of a single element and merging those sublists in a manner that results into a sorted list.

-quickSort_med3 - same as quickSort, but uses a 3 value median to define the pivot.

-coutingSort - works by determining the positions of each key value in the output sequence by counting the number of objects with distinct key values and applying prefix sum to those counts.

-bucketSort - a sorting algorithm that divides an array's elements into several buckets. The buckets are then sorted one at a time, either using a different sorting algorithm or by recursively 
applying the bucket sorting algorithm.

-shellSort -  a sorting algorithm that is highly efficient and is based on the insertion sort algorithm. This algorithm avoids large shifts, as in insertion sort, where the smaller value is on 
the far right and must be moved to the far left.

-pancakeSort - sorting a sequence of numbers in ascending order using only one type of operation - flipping. Flipping is a process of reversing the order of a specific number of elements in the 
sequence, starting from the first element.
